# 🎮 Simon Reimagined  

Modern Embedded System Implementation of the Classic Simon Game  


## 📌 Overview
Simon Reimagined is a fully redesigned, modern embedded version of the classic Simon memory game.  
The project includes:

- Custom circular PCB (V1.0)
- Arduino Nano–based firmware
- 3D‑printed mechanical housing
- Complete schematics and assembly documentation
- Tinkercad simulation environment
- Professional, print‑ready project documentation

## 🧠 Features
- Four colored buttons with matching LEDs  
- Unique tone for each color  
- Randomly generated sequences  
- Error feedback (audio + visual)  
- Power switch and buzzer  
- Fully custom PCB and enclosure  


## 🛠 Hardware Architecture

## Components
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
- 4× momentary push buttons (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- 4× LEDs with current‑limiting resistors
- Buzzer (4 kHz)
- ON/OFF toggle switch
- Custom circular PCB (designed in EasyEDA)
- 3D‑printed top/bottom housing + latch + buttons

## 💾 Firmware

## Language & Platform
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- State‑machine based game logic
- Debounced button input
- Tone generation per color


## 🧪 Simulation
Tinkercad simulation includes:

- Button logic
- LED feedback
- Buzzer tones
- Sequence playback

## 📄 Documentation
A full, print‑ready A4 documentation package is included
